## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the gallery.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

I did not have enough time to finish writing tests for everything that I wanted to test which would have included helper functions, mocking network calls upon user search and displaying results.
